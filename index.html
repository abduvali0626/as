              <h1>neutron stars</h1>
              <p>
                A neutron star is the collapsed core of a massive supergiant
                star. It results from the supernova explosion of a massive
                star—combined with gravitational collapse—that compresses the
                core past white dwarf star density to that of atomic nuclei.
                Surpassed only by black holes, neutron stars are the second
                smallest and densest known class of stellar objects.[1] Neutron
                stars have a radius on the order of 10 kilometers (6 mi) and a
                mass of about 1.4 M☉.[2] Stars that collapse into neutron stars
                have a total mass of between 10 and 25 solar masses (M☉), or
                possibly more for those that are especially rich in elements
                heavier than hydrogen and helium.[3]

              <h1>Pulsars</h1>
              <p>
                A pulsar (from puls(ating st)ar, on the model of quasar)[1] is a
                highly magnetized rotating neutron star that emits beams of
                electromagnetic radiation out of its magnetic poles.[2] This
                radiation can be observed only when a beam of emission is
                pointing toward Earth (similar to the way a lighthouse can be
                seen only when the light is pointed in the direction of an
                observer), and is responsible for the pulsed appearance of
                emission. Neutron stars are very dense and have short, regular
                rotational periods. This produces a very precise interval
                between pulses that ranges from milliseconds to seconds for an
                individual pulsar. Pulsars are one of the candidates for the
                source of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (see also centrifugal
                mechanism of acceleration.)

              <h1>millisecond pulsar</h1>
              <p>
                A millisecond pulsar (MSP) is a pulsar with a rotational period
                less than about 10 milliseconds. Millisecond pulsars have been
                detected in radio, X-ray, and gamma ray portions of the
                electromagnetic spectrum. The leading hypothesis for the origin
                of millisecond pulsars is that they are old, rapidly rotating
                neutron stars that have been spun up or "recycled" through
                accretion of matter from a companion star in a close binary
                system.[1][2] For this reason, millisecond pulsars are sometimes
                called recycled pulsars.

              <h1>magnetar</h1>
              <p>
                A magnetar is a type of neutron star with an extremely powerful
                magnetic field (~109 to 1011 T, ~1013 to 1015 G).[1] The
                magnetic-field decay powers the emission of high-energy
                electromagnetic radiation, particularly X-rays and gamma
                rays.[2]
